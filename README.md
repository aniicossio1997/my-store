## STORE with Typescript and Next

## Technologies

- 1. NodeJS
- 2. Next
- 3. Typescript
- 4. Redux
- 5. Chakra UI
- 6. Eslint

## Getting Started

You have add file .env.local and writing NEXT_PUBLIC_PRODUCTS=URLS_API, to connect the product API with the APP.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
